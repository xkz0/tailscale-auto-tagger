# Tailscale Auto-Tagger
### ðŸŽ¯ Use Regular Expressions To Add ACL Tags or Custom Values To Your Tailnet ðŸŽ¯
##### I have to manage a large number of devices at work, but thankfully the names (either hostnames or FQDNs) all follow schemas
##### This means that we can use the Tailscale API to push values to them based on this name
##### To setup all you need to do is enter your TS API key, specify your names (and/or ones to exclude) and fire away
#### This works in conjunction with AnsiScale, a little script I made that lets you make inventory files based on Tags or Custom data
